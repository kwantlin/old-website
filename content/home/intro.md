I am a Master's student at Princeton University in Computer Science, where I work within the fields of machine learning and multi-agent systems, advised by Prof. Naomi Leonard.

I'm interested in reproducing collective behavior and collective intelligence found in the natural world. This spans anything from understanding the dynamics of coupled robotic swarms using models from physics to modeling the activation of biological units that underly human cognition. Understanding how groups of agents in the natural world are optimized to solve their problems would aid engineers and scientists in building more efficient AI teams and is a problem area that spans computer science, robotics, biology, and more.

Previously, I received my A.B in Computer Science with a secondary in Economics and Chinese Language Citation from Harvard University. My undergraduate thesis, advised by Prof. David Parkes and Dr. Sarah Keren, applied market-based techniques to enable cooperative multi-robot environment mapping under uncertainty.
